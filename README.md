## Overview

Simple Chest Shop is a streamlined, user-friendly chest shop plugin designed specifically for Paper servers running Minecraft 1.21.3 with Py-Spigot. This project aims to bridge the gap between overly complex shop plugins and the need for a straightforward, intuitive solution, especially for neurodivergent players and server owners who value simplicity. It integrates seamlessly with TownyAdvanced, allowing players to easily create and manage shops within their towns or plots. This plugin supports Geyser, enabling Bedrock Edition players to enjoy the same chest shop experience as their Java Edition counterparts.

Inspired by classic Java-based chest shop plugins that may not be compatible with the latest Minecraft versions, Simple Chest Shop offers a fresh take, built from the ground up with accessibility and ease of use in mind.

## Core Principles

*   **Simplicity:**  Minimalist design with a focus on essential features. No overwhelming commands or convoluted configurations.
*   **User-Friendly:** Intuitive for both players and server administrators.
*   **Neurodiversity-Affirmative:** Developed with consideration for neurodivergent players, prioritizing clear instructions, predictable behavior, and customizable settings.
*   **Modern Compatibility:** Built for Paper servers running Minecraft 1.20.1 using Py-Spigot.
*   **Community-Driven:** Open-source and welcoming contributions from developers of all backgrounds.

## Why Another Chest Shop Plugin?

Many existing chest shop plugins are feature-rich but often come with a steep learning curve, excessive commands, and complex security configurations. This can be particularly challenging for neurodivergent players or server owners seeking a hassle-free experience. Simple Chest Shop aims to provide a streamlined alternative that focuses on core functionality without sacrificing usability. We believe that a chest shop plugin should be easy to understand, configure, and use, regardless of one's experience level or neurotype.

## Development Plan

This project is currently in the early stages of development. We are focusing on building a solid foundation with the following planned integrations:

*   **TownyAdvanced:** Seamless integration with TownyAdvanced for town-based shop management, permissions, and potential tax features.
*   **Vault:** Robust economy support using the widely adopted Vault plugin.
*   **LuckPerms:** Granular permission control to tailor the chest shop experience to your server's needs.
*   **Geyser/Floodgate:** Support for Bedrock Edition players connecting through Geyser, with potential Floodgate integration for account linking.

**Future Considerations:**

*   **GUI Support:** Exploring options for a graphical user interface to enhance user experience, especially for Bedrock players.
*   **Customization:** Providing extensive configuration options to allow server owners to personalize the plugin's behavior and appearance.
*   **Community Feedback:** Actively seeking and incorporating feedback from users to improve the plugin.
