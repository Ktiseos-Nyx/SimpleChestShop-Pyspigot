# Simple Chest Shop - Py-Spigot Edition

<hr>

## Overview

Simple Chest Shop is a streamlined, user-friendly chest shop plugin designed specifically for Paper servers running Minecraft 1.21.3 with Py-Spigot. This project aims to bridge the gap between overly complex shop plugins and the need for a straightforward, intuitive solution, especially for neurodivergent players and server owners who value simplicity. It integrates seamlessly with TownyAdvanced, allowing players to easily create and manage shops within their towns or plots. This plugin supports Geyser, enabling Bedrock Edition players to enjoy the same chest shop experience as their Java Edition counterparts. Inspired by classic Java-based chest shop plugins that may not be compatible with the latest Minecraft versions, Simple Chest Shop offers a fresh take, built from the ground up with accessibility and ease of use in mind.

## Why Another Chest Shop Plugin?

Many existing chest shop plugins are feature-rich but often come with a steep learning curve, excessive commands, and complex security configurations. This can be particularly challenging for neurodivergent players or server owners seeking a hassle-free experience. Simple Chest Shop aims to provide a streamlined alternative that focuses on core functionality without sacrificing usability. We believe that a chest shop plugin should be easy to understand, configure, and use, regardless of one's experience level or neurotype.
