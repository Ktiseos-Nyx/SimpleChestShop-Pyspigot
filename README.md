# Simple Chest Shop - Py-Spigot Edition

**Effortless Chest Shops for Your Minecraft Server**

## Overview

Simple Chest Shop is a plugin designed to bring intuitive and efficient chest shop functionality to your PySpigot server. If you've been seeking a straightforward, user-friendly shop system without the overwhelming complexity of many alternatives, look no further!

This plugin streamlines the shop creation and management experience for both players and administrators, focusing on core functionality and ease of use. With seamless integrations with TownyAdvanced and Geyser, you can empower your community with a robust and accessible trading system.

Built to fill the needs of the 0FTH3N1GHT's development server, Simple Chest Shop prioritizes clean design and a smooth, enjoyable user experience. Development is ongoing.

## Languages 

English, but future development pending- we'll work in more languages. 

## Developed with PySpigot

This plugin is written in Python using PySpigot. Python's natural language-like syntax and the vast ecosystem of available libraries have made it easier to develop. I used the combination of lack of smarts, and studying at what feels like 3am all the API's I need to include. While the use of LLM's has been employed, trust me, this isn't just "telling GPT to make it" - i'm checking all the code, i'm linting where i'm able. I'm learning a long the way. I'm excited to continue expanding my skills and making this plugin the best it can be!

## Why Simple Chest Shop?

Many chest shop plugins are bloated with overwhelming command sets, intricate configurations, and steep learning curves. Simple Chest Shop offers a refreshing alternative:

*   **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and use for both players and administrators.
*   **Accessibility:** Supports both Java and Bedrock Edition clients.
*   **Focus:** Provides the *essential* chest shop experience without unnecessary features.
*   **Performance:** Lightweight design ensures minimal impact on server performance.

Simple Chest Shop is perfect for servers that value ease of use, a clean gameplay experience, and a focus on core functionality without sacrificing essential features.
